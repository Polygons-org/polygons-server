# Polygons Server
This repository is for the server for polygons. The actual game is [here.](https://github.com/Polygons-org/polygons)

This server uses apache, PHP, and mariadb so you need both of those to run it.

# Guide on Making a Private Server
First install apache, PHP, and mariadb. Then clone/fork this repo to anywhere apache can access.

I haven't added database stuff yet so for now thats it. It's just a good idea to install mariadb in advance imo.
